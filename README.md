# shopping_cart_JS
Shopping cart made in plain OOP JavaScript

The whole code is located in an object named shoppingCart and everything runs with one init function: shoppingCart.init ();

Products and all product information are read from the products.js file in which the products are placed in the facility with more facilities, one for each product.

Not responsive because my primary goal for this “small project” was JavaScript.
